1. Words are bridges.
Use English, for your code shall speak to the world.

2. Names breathe meaning.
Let every variable be a whisper of its purpose.

3. Silence in clutter.
Avoid meaningless words — no foo, no bar, no abc.

4. Speak clearly, even in comments.
Your future self will thank you for your kindness.

5. Commit with intention.
Each message, a chapter in the story of your code.

6. Avoid the tongue of your homeland.
No 拼音, no 中文, no secrets only locals understand.

7. Logs are not cries, but calm echoes.
Let every error teach, not confuse.

8. Be readable, like a scroll unrolled.
Code is not magic. It is clarity made manifest.

9. Respect the eyes of others.
Format, indent, align — beauty is legibility.

10. Share your style.
Let your team walk the same path. Write the rules. Keep them close
